## Useful Scripts 

1. mergePDF.sh - This is a quick bash script that uses ghostscript (gs) to merge serveral PDF files together
2. convertToMP4.sh - Convert MKV files in a given directory to MP4. Used this for my plex server since MP4 can be made web optimized so its faster to stream and doesnt require transcoding on the fly. Make sure you backup the mkv files though, it might not be a universal solution but it worked for every file I had.
